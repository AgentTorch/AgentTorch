## Census Data Processing

We process the NYC census data for AgentTorch experiment here

Steps of data processing:
1. Step 1 -> Process Census data into standardized dataframes (for agents and households)
2. Step 2 -> Convert Dataframe into synthetic populations using syspop (for agents and households)
3. Step 3 -> Load the Sypop pickled data into AgentTorch simulation
