# Differentiable Discrete Sampling using AgentTorch

## Introduction
This is an attempt to implement various discrete classes and functions in PyTorch. The goal is to provide a simple and efficient way to sample from and evaluate discrete distributions in AgentTorch. The distributions are implemented as PyTorch modules, which allows them to be used in combination with other PyTorch modules. The distributions are also differentiable, which allows them to be used in combination with other differentiable modules.
