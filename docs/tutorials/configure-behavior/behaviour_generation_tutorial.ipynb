    "\n",
    "Our framework is designed to simulate population behaviors using AI agents. It combines several key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LLM Agents**: We use Large Language Models (LLMs) to create intelligent agents that can make decisions based on given scenarios.\n",
    "- **Archetypes**: These represent different types of individuals in a population.\n",
    "- **Behaviors**: These simulate how individuals might act in various situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This framework is particularly useful for modeling complex social or economic scenarios, such as population responses during a pandemic."
