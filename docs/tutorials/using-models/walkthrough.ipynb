       " 'output': 'The analysis of the simulation data shows that inflation has a varying impact on consumption behavior across different demographics. Here are some key observations:\\n\\n1. For younger age groups (20-29), the impact of inflation on consumption propensity is minimal. This could be due to their relatively lower assets and income levels.\\n\\n2. For the age group under 19, the impact of inflation is more pronounced. This could be due to their reliance on fixed income sources like allowances or part-time jobs, which do not adjust for inflation.\\n\\n3. Across different regions, the impact of inflation on consumption behavior also varies. For instance, in the Wellington region, the impact of inflation is more noticeable compared to the Bay of Plenty region.\\n\\n4. The impact of inflation on consumption behavior also varies by ethnicity and gender. For instance, the Asian and Hispanic communities show a higher impact of inflation on their consumption behavior compared to other ethnicities. Similarly, females show a higher impact of inflation on their consumption behavior compared to males.\\n\\nThese observations suggest that inflation can affect consumption behavior in complex ways, depending on various demographic and economic factors.'}"
