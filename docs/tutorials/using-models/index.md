#### Simulation Input

`Simulation Input` : Input to our simulation is a dataset consisting of
population generated based on the census data of a specific region. We have
currently generated population for New York City and New Zealand.

Lets see how the population data looks like for New Zealand

```python
NZ_SYNTHETIC_POPULATION_PATH = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'simulator_data/census_populations/NZ/synthetic_populations/population_data.pkl')

nz_population = pd.read_pickle(NZ_SYNTHETIC_POPULATION_PATH)
nz_population.head(5)
```

<div>

        vertical-align: middle;
    }

    .dataframe tbody tr th {
        vertical-align: top;
    }

    .dataframe thead th {
        text-align: right;
    }

The above data shows the population attributes of 5 agents, like 'age',
'gender', 'region where the agent resides', 'ethnicity' and 'area code of
residence'. We assign these attributes to each of our simulated agents, to mimic
real world population dynamic.

We also provide APIs to generate your own synthetic population, though we will
not get into the details here.

## Run Simulation

`Dataloader` is the common interface to load, setup or modify the simulation
parameters such as Number of Runs, Population Size, Region for which Population
data is to be used. It also does the necessary pipelining to setup the flow of
simulation.

It compiles a config file which is used by the Executor to run the simulation.

```python
from AgentTorch.dataloader import DataLoader

# 'populations' is the package where generated population for each region is saved.
# We are picking New Zealand's (NZ) population for this run.
from populations import NZ

# 'models' is the package where the simulation logic for different use cases are defined.
# We are picking the macro_economics model for this simulation. It models the population's economic behavior during covid, by simulating a financial market.
from models import macro_economics
from macro_economics.config import NUM_AGENTS

# Initialize the data loader with the preferred model and the region's population.
data_loader = DataLoader(model = macro_economics, region = NZ, population_size = NUM_AGENTS)

```

Example 1: Use `Executor` API to run a simulation

```python
# Executor is the common interface to run simulation
# It takes the model and data loader as input and executes the simulation.
from AgentTorch.execute import Executor

agents_sim = Executor(model = macro_economics,data_loader = data_loader)
agents_sim.execute()

```

Example 2: Use `DataLoader` API to customize the agent - Make LLM an Agent

Let's modify the prompt used by our LLM Agent, and re-run the simulation

Original Prompt is : "You are {gender} of age {age}, living in the {region}
region. It is {month} {year}, number of covid cases is {covid_cases}. The price
of Essential Goods is {price_of_goods}. With all these factors in play, and
considering aspects like your living costs, any future aspirations, and the
broader economic trends, how is your willingness to work this month?
Furthermore, how would you plan your expenditures? "

We will modify this to remove the information about `price of essential goods`.
This might, help us understand the population/market behaviour when info on
inflation is not present.

```python
MODIFIED_EARNING_ACTION_PROMPT = "You are {gender} of age {age}, living in the {region} region. It is {month} {year}, number of covid cases is {covid_cases}. With all these factors in play, and considering aspects like your living costs, any future aspirations, and the broader economic trends, how is your willingness to work this month? Furthermore, how would you plan your expenditures? "
data_loader.set_config_attribute('EARNING_ACTION_PROMPT', MODIFIED_EARNING_ACTION_PROMPT)

agent_sim_modified = Executor(model = macro_economics,data_loader = data_loader)
# With this set, we can now run the simulation again using the executor.
agent_sim_modified.execute()
```

## Visualize Results

Simulations produce a state trace

More info on state trace ....

```python
from macro_economics.config import STATE_TRACE_PATH
from AgentTorch.LLM.llm_qa import load_state_trace

state_trace = load_state_trace(STATE_TRACE_PATH,NZ_NUM_AGENTS)
state_trace[0].columns
```

    Index(['ID', 'age', 'area', 'assets', 'consumption_propensity', 'ethnicity',
           'gender', 'household', 'monthly_income', 'post_tax_income', 'region',
           'will_work', 'month', 'year'],
          dtype='object')

Example 3: Use `Visualizer` API to engage the simulation trace for retrospective
and prospective analysis

```python
# Visualizer is the helper class to visualize the output variables of the simulation
# As we would expect, it takes simulation trace as input
from AgentTorch.visualize import Visualizer
visualizer = Visualizer(state_trace)
```

```python
# We can plot a few variables of interest like Consumption Propensity and Will to Work.
visualizer.plot('consumption_propensity')
```

## Talk with Simulation

`Q/A` : AgentTorch gives you the ability to perform Q/A with the simulation,
through its integration of simulation trace and conversation history with th
Analysis Agent (LLM Agent).

##### Configuration

```python
from macro_economics.config import OPENAI_API_KEY
conversations_memory_directory = ROOT_DIR + 'populations/NZ/simulation_memory_output/2020/9'
state_trace_path = ROOT_DIR + 'populations/NZ/state_data_dict.pkl'
```

##### Analyze

`DocumentRetriever` : It sets up a vector db containing all the converations
intiated with the LLM Agent, during the runtime of the simulation.

```python
from AgentTorch.LLM.llm_qa import DocumentRetriever
conversation_memory_retriever = DocumentRetriever(directory=conversation_memory_directory)
```

    Batches:   0%|          | 0/16 [00:00<?, ?it/s]

`SimulationAnalysisAgent` abstracts away the logic for analysis module, so you
can do what's more fun, that is analyzing the simulation behaviour.

```python
from AgentTorch.LLM.llm_qa import SimulationAnalysisAgent
analyser = SimulationAnalysisAgent(openai_api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY, document_retriever=memory_retriever, temperature=0, state_trace_path=state_trace_path)
```

```python
analyser.query("Which age group has lowest median income, how much is it?")

    Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to produce the answer. We need to consider several factors: 1. **Age and Health Risk**: At age 65, you are in a higher risk category for COVID-19. This increases the risk associated with working, especially if your job cannot be done remotely. 2. **COVID-19 Cases**: The number of cases in the Otago region has decreased from 874.0 to 701.0. This indicates a positive trend, but the risk of infection is still present. 3. **Price of Essential Goods**: The price has slightly increased from 12.0 to 12.012574195861816. This indicates inflation but not at a significant rate that would drastically change consumption habits. 4. **Economic Trends and

    [283900 rows x 16 columns][0m[32;1m[1;3mThe analysis of the simulation data shows that inflation has a varying impact on consumption behavior across different demographics. Here are some key observations:

    1. For younger age groups (20-29), the impact of inflation on consumption propensity is minimal. This could be due to their relatively lower assets and income levels.

    2. For the age group under 19, the impact of inflation is more pronounced. This could be due to their reliance on fixed income sources like allowances or part-time jobs, which do not adjust for inflation.

    3. Across different regions, the impact of inflation on consumption behavior also varies. For instance, in the Wellington region, the impact of inflation is more noticeable compared to the Bay of Plenty region.

    4. The impact of inflation on consumption behavior also varies by ethnicity and gender. For instance, the Asian and Hispanic communities show a higher impact of inflation on their consumption behavior compared to other ethnicities. Similarly, females show a higher impact of inflation on their consumption behavior compared to males.

    These observations suggest that inflation can affect consumption behavior in complex ways, depending on various demographic and economic factors.[0m
